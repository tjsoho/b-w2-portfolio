# Project Title

Week 2 Assignment: Portfolio

## Description
The purpose of this READme is to provide a detailed description of my personal portfolio to show to prospective employers.

The site can be accessed via this link:
https://tjsoho.github.io/b-w2-portfolio/ 

### This repository contains:
* A READme file detailing the assignment and the site
* Html.index file
* Assets folder that contains the following:
* Png file of the site
* Png file of the wire frame
* Css folder containing css style sheet
* Images for the site
* A reset CSS style sheet
* A blank folder for future use for videos

This site was built from scratch. No code was provided to begin.

I started by using a wire frame to design the site followed by laying out the sections in HTML. I build this site from Desktop down which proved some difficulties when trying to resize. I am interested to see the ease difference next site I build by starting with the mobile first principal.

Areas that I found particularly difficult were understanding how to use and operate flex-box to suite my resizing needs.

Below is a screenshot of what the site looks like now.

The wire frame within the repo is not identitcal to the site as I decided to make some design changes along the way.
