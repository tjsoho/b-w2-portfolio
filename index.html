      <p>
        Toby J (Toby J Carroll) is an international, multi - instrumentalist performer and business owner.
        <br>
        <br>
        Toby has mastered the violin, saxophone, guitar, piano and vocals touring his talents across Europe, Asia,
        United States and Africa.
        <br>
        <br>
        After a 10 year career teaching in private schools across Sydney’s North Shore, Toby established a boutique
        music education business, iRock Music Studios.
        <br>
        <br>
        With a primary focus on student driven learning, Toby’s vision for iRock being a holistic approach to children
        and adolescent development, through the prism of music education, was and continues to be a successful business.
        Creative playground, Team Trust and Confident Leading are the core values at iRock. Toby has personally coached
        every team member to nurture and foster students with the encouragement of finding their voice figuratively,
        literally and emotionally.
        <br>
        <br>
        Toby is currently in the process of setting up a number of new businesses whilst taking a step back from the day
        to day running on the music school..
